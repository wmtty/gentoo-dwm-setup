* Overview
This repository contains a DWM setup, including:
- dwm (window manager)
- dmenu (application launcher)
- slock (lock screen)
- slstatus (status bar)
- dunst (notification daemon)
- sxhkd (hotkey daemon)

The installation script automates setup, config copying, and script installation.

* Requirements
- Linux system
- Build tools: gcc, make, X11 development libraries
- working xorg setup must be there

* Installation
All steps are automated via the provided install.sh script. Run the following from the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/wmtty/gentoo-dwm-setup.git
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
#+END_SRC

This will:
- Compile and install dwm, dmenu, slock, slstatus
- Copy dunst configuration to ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
- Copy sxhkd configuration to ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
- Install helper scripts (dmenu-* to ~/.local/bin, .xinitrc to ~/, x11autostart.sh to ~/.config/auto)

* Configuration
** Themes
- dwm themes are located in dwm/themes/
- The active theme is included in config.h via relative include, e.g. #include "themes/nord.h"

** dunst
- dunstrc configuration is copied to ~/.config/dunst/
- Existing configurations are backed up automatically as dunstrc.bak

** sxhkd
- sxhkdrc configuration is copied to ~/.config/sxhkd/
- Existing configurations are backed up automatically as sxhkdrc.bak

* Scripts
- dmenu-desktop: Launch desktop entries via dmenu
- dmenu-logoutmenu: Simple logout menu
- dmenu-bluetooth: Connect to Bluetooth devices via dmenu
- x11autostart.sh: Autostart script for dwm sessions
- .xinitrc: Startx configuration to launch dwm

* Notes
- The install script is verbose and color-coded for easy debugging
- One-time sudo session is used to install tools
- All config files and scripts are installed from the repository working directory
- Backup of existing configurations is automatic
- Make sure to install dependency
